	They sat with their backs to each other, only their clothing touching.
	"So um, how do you want to, uh, do all of this?"
	"I'm not really sure."
	"Oh. That, that's okay."
	"Is it?"
	"Um, yeah."
	She inhaled, as if preparing to say something big and consequential, but the stench of Silence's corpse, having been hanged between them, kept anything she had to say from the both of them.
	"I think- I think I'm going to go first."
	"Uh, sure." She rubbed a thumb on the side pocket of her pants. The button there seemed to scream that it wasn't a lucky coin and that she should throw herself down a well if she wanted Fortune to change.
	"I still don't trust you. For what you did."
	"Understandable." She wiggled her toes and the stone floor probably sent some Radon to stick a few extra straight-pin markers in them.
	"How do you know I won't tell?"
	"I don't. It's entirely your choice."
	The sound of a toilet flushing echoed somewhere and then a throat cleared. Probably, Discontent was just smiling.
	"You know, you're a real piece of work."
	"I know." She watched the hairs on her forearms stand at attention, ready to march her out of the small room. The little wrinkles on her knuckles grew to crowded mountains and then snowy plateaus.
	"Such a bitch. You're the reason for your own pain."
	"Am I now?"
	"Yes. And not just now, you've always been-"
	"Is that how you sleep at night?"
	"Wha-? No, this isn't abou-"
	"Is that what you tell yourself? That it's right, what you're doing? I just wanna know." The air tasted cold, ubiquitous, and poorly painted, like license plates. Then, some clanking in the walls.
	"Fuck you. You keep deflecting it onto me. You always have. You could've worked for Trump with those ski-"
	"If I'm crazy, like you say, then I can't be blamed for my actions."
	"Ye-wait, no! You're still responsible! For everything, you snake-" She stood up and walked away, walked towards a much browner and monotonous Piet Mondrian, a rusted steel sculpture, an artistic trap.
	"Jeff. Is that what you'd like to be called?"
	"Yes, but-"
	"I don't like the name, but I'll use it. Jeff, have you ever made an attempt to understand me?"
	"Have you ever made an attempt to understand me?"
	"Actually, I don't think we were ever different enough that I had to." She paced, her lame foot trailing behind the rest of her the way the Placenta trails behind the newborn monkey it is still attached to.
	"You're nothing like me!" The floor seemed to protest as he smacked it with both hands. She felt the sting on his hands without looking, and another bone promised to bruise next week because of it.
	"A large household. Haphazard money habits. Social ostracization. Body image and self-esteem issues. Impostor syndrome. Impractical ambitions. An irritable mother simply trying to do her best. An emotionally-controlling father with some kind of god-complex. Siblings who seemed to get everything you wished you'd had. The list goes on, but that more or less covers it."
	"You shouldn't be talking! This is all your fault. All of it, fucking bitch, I oughtta-" He made as if to get up, his hand already on his knee and his chest heaving, but the clack of a shoe on the other side of the hall seemed to step on him before he was even up.
	"Did you come just to rile me up? To rub it my face one last time? You really are one sick bi-"
	"I came to say that I forgive you." Silence's white eyes opened briefly and a moth seemed to flicker there, between the lashes. "I just didn't know how to say it in a way that would make you believe me."
	Perhaps Discontentment sneered again, and a hacking cough ricocheted off the hallway walls. He half-chortled in a way that made his throat refuse to move with a childish, wholesome petulance.
	"Are you trying to save me with your holier-than-thou attitude? That I'll be some brown-nose-lapdog bitch just like you right before the end just because you forgave me? Forget about it you whore. You never apologized to me."
	"What you did was still wrong. But I don't believe that it'll condemn you. Only if you let it make you wrong too."
	"Cut your crap and leave." The floor looked up and would've reached out to caress a broken foot, but he yelled. “Just go already!"
	The clacking came, a train confined to its tracks. In the place of a steam engine stood a man, keys applauding at the homecoming of a veteran. They were silent with the screech of a halting train; no, a barred door opening.
	"Rukaiya."
	"That's ma'am to you."
	"Ma'am. It's time."
	"I'm not done speaking to him."
	"I'm done speaking to her!"
	"You're aggravating the inmate. I'm going to have to ask you to leave, Ru-ma'am."
	"At least tell me you ‘ll talk to the Chaplain. Any chaplain." She turned to face him fully, but a Hand had twisted her orange-clad horse to face the other side of the board.
	"Don't fucking try me."
	She flinched when something warm touched her shoulder, and the motor room inside the train flinched as he removed his hand.
	"He's a lost cause."
	"No, Jae, he's-"
	"I get it, he's your brother, but-"
	"That woman is not my blood."
	"-it's not your fault he turned out the way he did."
	"Just listen to the Chaplain. You don't have to have some life-changing spiritual experience, just-just, I just want-"
	"Rukaiya, you're only going to provoke him more. Letting you come here was a mistake-"
	"Jae stop. Rob-Jeff, maybe the Chaplain can give you something I couldn't. Maybe he can give you some peace or something to smile abo-"
	"Bitch, if you don't leave, I'll kill you and your pretty-boy husband right now, you have unti-"
	"That's it, we're going. We're leaving, I'm taking her. No need for threats." The clacking chugged along, dragging a new load by a joint. The keys chattered, a quick farewell with pastel-colored handkerchiefs. A hand was raised to stop the other pairs of clacking shoes that had come.
	"Jeff, I-please, you have to-"
	"No, we are leaving and you are not going to say anymore. Please." An erratic rolling and yawing ship was tugged along by the steam engine. It cut its yoke only after leaving the glass doors to a universe.
	"Rukaiya. Please." Something red floundered on the tracks before the train.
	"Jae, I-" The station trembled as the train whistled in the distance.
	"You can't save him. It's not your job to. You know Who's job that is."
	"But I still-"
	"You've done more than enough."
	"More than enough? He's still-"
	"You forgave him. After everything, you don't have to do any more."
	"I don't have to do any more? Jae, what the hell are you-"
	"Ru, listen to me, you-"
	"-trying to say? Have you lost your mind?"
	"You're an orphan because of him." Silence sat upwards in it grave and painted slowly her face with the whites of its eyes.
	"You're an only child because of him."
	"I am not an only child, he's still-" The moth came close, but the orange flame had died down before it could turn its wings black.
	"I can't be a father, dammit. Because of him."
	"You haven't forgiven him."
	"If you lose any more of your life to him, I don't think I can."
	"There isn't much time. Left to forgive him, I mean." Water had made its way onto the red deck. Somewhere, a toilet flushed again, and on the other side of the world, a well overflowed.
	"I watched that camcorder footage in the courtroom with you."
	"Jae-"
	"Every time you step a foot closer to this place, all I see is-"
	"-don't-"
	"-you crying over your mom-"
	"-I'm sorry, I-"
	"-him gutting you-"
	"-didn't even think-"
	"-the blood all over your living room floor-"
	"-enough about you."
	"-it makes me want to kill him."
	A TV screen flickered on and off, then shook from right to left. "No. No, we are not going there, I-"
	"I know. I'd be no better than him. But I'm so-"
	"-hurt." The TV is switched on, the remote trained on it. “It feels like anger and it's sad and it doesn't feel real, but mostly, it just hurts. I know. Just… put it aside. We have to keep going somehow. Let's go. Let's go home."
	She took his arm and led him to her car, and only when he wiped his eyes with the back of his hand did she look back at the barred windows on the building, imagining she saw an orange flame in one of them.
