	Hello! This website was created as a final project for the Fall 2018 course 'PLME 0400: Medical Illustration' at Brown University. We chose to investigate the health impacts of energy drinks and disseminate that information through our visual creations. We'd like to give attribution to <a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/127/3/511.full.pdf">Seifert et al.</a> for their 2010 publication, which served as our major source on this project.
