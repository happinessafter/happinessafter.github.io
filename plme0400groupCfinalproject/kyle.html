<h2>What is an energy drink?</h2>
Energy drinks are beverages advertised to stimulate energy, stamina, concentration, weight loss, and athleticism. Energy drinks are not the same as sports drinks or vitamin waters.  

<h2>What ingredients are in energy drinks?</h2>
Energy drinks often contain ingredients like sugars and sweeteners, herbal supplements, and taurine, but the primary ingredient is caffeine. The caffeine in energy drinks can be further amplified through additives like kola nut, cocoa, yerba mate, and guarana. The graphic below illustrates the average caffeine content for several popular products that contain caffeine. 

<h2>What does energy drink consumption look like in the United States?</h2>
In the United States, 30% to 50% of adolescents and young adults consume energy drinks. The average consumption is 60-70 mg of caffeine per day (the equivalent of one cup of tea) but can reach up to 800 mg/day (the equivalent of three tall Starbucks coffees). According to one study, regular energy drink consumption was about 28% for 12-14 year-olds, 31% for 12-17 year-olds, and 34% for 18-24 year-olds. Additionally, another study that surveyed 496 college students found that consumption of one energy drink per month was 51% among college students with the majority of regular consumers drinking energy drinks several times per week.
