youre just a burden                    
to everyone                        
youre better off dead             
but taking your own 
life is        
an arrogance you can
not dare       
to have                   
a burden                         
to everyone                  
your own life is          

you cannot dare

better off-           

"The thing is, I'm 
not very smart. I 
may have
been taught some 
smart things, but I
 can't really 
do much with them. 
Someone smarter probably 
could do a lot more
with less. I mean,
I also
do really stupid stuff
all the time. I would s
ay I'm 
average. On the normal
distribution curve I 
would be
somewhere near that
whole heap in the
middle of
most people. Probably 
in the lower standard
deviation of average
range too. I'm nothing 
special. I haven't
effected great change on 
any scale really,
and my few and far
in between
accomplishments don't
amount to more than 
the number of honey BBQ
chips I can
fit in my mouth in one
go or the number
of kittens there is
space for on my lap. 
I'm sure
Guinness World Records 
could show that even in
those things I'm not
particularly exceptional.
But
that's okay. I think 
that we wouldn't have
a top
10% or top .2% or 
whatever percentage without
the corresponding bottom 
percent. The exceptional
have no one to help with 
their talents without the
average. And the below-average 
don't have anyone
to be helped by without 
the average and the above-
average. It is because 
I am average that I can see
how special the above-average 
are. And I've been
fortunate enough to meet 
a lot of amazing people.
I think what I used to 
struggle with was wanting
very intensely to be 
more than the mean. That
was probably where the
 envy came from. But
once I accepted that 
I'm really not all that,
I found so much more 
peace as envy was
replaced by appreciation
 and awe. It's
like I'm in my own 
little cubbyhole, made
just for me in the 
greater scheme of things.
And I get to watch all 
of the really special
people go by and attain 
greater things. I get
to help them see the 
potential they don't
see in themselves, the 
potential they've
become too familiar with 
to notice because
it is their own. Little ol' 
me (well, by the size
of my hips not so little 
haha) may not be
able to do much on her 
own, but she's
content to help others 
do what she can't.
Think of me like a
library-
chances are you
don't have to go very 
far to find one of
me in a place, and 
the information
I have is no good 
without someone
to read it and put 
it to use. Feel free to flip
through a magazine 
casually or look for
something you might 
need. If you're
doubting yourself, 
I've got just the book. 
It
took me a while, but 
I think I’ve found my
niche."
